# YOLOUdacityDatasetObjDetSFSunset
Use Udacity YOLO dataset to identify cars, persons, and traffic light.  This repository will use Chris Gundling's YOLO github 
as a reference.

Instruction to run the YOLO object detection executable command:
1)Before running the executable file, download the tiny-yolov2-udacity.tar.gz from this link:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2K7eATT8qRAY0g0aWhjdkw0bEU/view .  Unzip the zip file and copy into the scripts/ckpt directory.  We will use the checkpoint
for our YOLO object detection.
2) In the scripts directory in linux or ubuntu, type the executable command: ./YOLOobjectDetect and from windows anaconda prompt or linux or ubuntu prompt in the same directory type:  jupyter notebook pedestrianDetection.ipynb.  This command will produce 
YOLO object detection videos from the videos I took from the San Francisco Sunset District.  If you want my videos to run YOLOobjectDetect script, please just send me an email at blei139@gmail.com, or you can use your own videos to run this script.
